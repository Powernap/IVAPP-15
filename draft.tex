\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Epidemiology is the study of causation of diseases.
%%
Large population studies, such as the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) \ref{SHIP} gather as much information as possible about participants to be assessed towards different diseases.
%%
These information are used to determine risk factors for diseases, helping people to make their lifestyle healthier or helping in diagnosing a disease.
%%
Epidemiological research is strongly hypothesis driven.
%
Observations made by clinicians are translated into hypothesis, which are then statistically evaluated using data variables from epidemiological studies.

Modern cohort studies often comprise medical image data.
%%
\com{Short summary}
%%

Back pain is one of the most frequent diseases in the western civilization.
%%

Our goal is to combine data mining algorithm with data visualization to provide insight into the quality of image derived data to analyze if it acts as a risk factor for a disease.
%\com{Combine Data Mining Algo}

More than 5 variables are rarely analyzed simultaneously.
%%
%The variables analyzed simultaneously is limited to 
Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyzing back pain using image-derived variables of 2,240 subjects.
	\item Assessing the suitability of lumbar spine shape for diagnosing back pain
	\item Analyzing correlations between between image-based and socio-demographic as well as medical parameters.
	\item Identification of most important variables using data mining methods \com{noch schoen schreiben}
	\item semiquantitative Auswertmöglichkeiten werden dem User oft zur verfügung gestellt
	\item Techniken sind als Teil des IVA-Frameworkes zu verstehen

\section{\uppercase{Epidemiological Background}}
\label{sec:EpidemiologicalBackground}
%\noindent \com{Background. Epidemiological Workflow, focus on statistical resilience, image data hard to analyze due to the large amount of subjects, poor image quality and lack of methods}.
\noindent Epidemiology is the study of dissemination, causes and results of health-related states and events.
%%
Epidemiological reasoning relies on a strict statistically driven workflow \cite{Fletcher}:
%%
\begin{itemize}
%%
	\item Physicians formulate hypotheses based on observations made in their clinical practice.
%%
	\item To assess a hypothesis, epidemiologists compile a list of variables depicting it.
%%
	\item Statistical methods, such as regression analysis, assess the association of selected variables with the investigated disease.
%%
\end{itemize}
%%
Mutually dependent variables make this analysis challenging.
%%
Many diseases, such as different cancer types, are more likely with increasing age.
%%
When for example analyzing influences of nutrition to prostate cancer, the results need to be age-normalized.
%%
Age acts as an \emph{confounder} for prostate cancer.
%%
These \emph{confounding} variables are often hard to find.
%%
Statistical correlation does not imply causation--epidemiologists need to assess the medical soundness of the statistical results.

\subsection{Lower Back Pain}
% \com{Back pain one of the most common diseases in the western civilization; hard to analyze; Epidemiologists interested in the \emph{healthy} aging process}.
%
% Risk factors for are not completely known, thus epidemiologists search for new correlations in cohort studies.
Lower back pain is one of the most frequent diseases in the western civilization.
%%
Epidemiologists assume associations between lumbar back pain and lifestyle factors.
%%
These include nutrition, sporting activities and body posture at work.
%%
The exact causes as well as particularly vulnerable risk groups are not known.
%%
Interaction between risk factors are also not known.
%%

Epidemiologists want to characterize the healthy aging process of the spine.
%%
To achieve this, they have to analyze the lumbar spine shape as well as the mentioned lifestyle factors.
%% -------------------
\subsection{Epidemiological Data}
Epidemiological data can stem from a wide range of studies.
%%
The study type depends on the condition of interest.
%%
Most common are case-control studies, analyzing one specific disease and its influences.
%%
We focus on data from large scale cohort studies.
%%
These studies aim to collect as much data as possible for each subject.
%%
As a result, these data can be analyzed regarding many diseases and conditions.
%%

Epidemiological data is heterogenous and incomplete.
%%
Women-specific question can only be acquired for female subjects, data about a disease treatment only for subjects suffering from this condition.
%%
Therefore, statistical analysis has to take missing data into account.
%%

Epidemiologists acquire data using a wide range of techniques, such as medical examinations, self reported questionnaires or genetic examinations.
%%
This yields a heterogenous information space.
%%
To compare these data, information reduction techniques are applied.
%%
For example, continuous data, such as age is often discretized into age-bins.
%%
Every information reduction can introduce a bias to the data, since it reflects an assumption about the data.
%%
Using age to divide subjects into \emph{young} and \emph{old} categories can distort statistical results.
%%
This distortion is reduced with increasing number of discretization steps.
%%

Modern cohort studies often comprise medical image data.
%%
These data are hard to analyze, since segmentation algorithms are not generally available and need to be custom-made for each body structure.
%%
Segmentation data is usually analyzed by abstracting it into key figures, such as diameters or distances.
%%
These numeric values can be compared with non-image variables to retrieve correlations.

\subsection{Non-Image Data}
\com{Analysis Using Heterogeneous Correlation}
The variables range from somatometric variables describing body measures to medical examinations, such as laboratory tests as well as lifestyle factors as sport activity or nutrition.

\com{Es wurde mit einem weiten Spektrum Daten gesammelt, vom denen man glaubt, dass sie irgendwas mit der Wirbelsäulenverformung und dem Alterungsprozess zu tun haben. It is an active research area to determine these correlations.}

\subsection{Image Data}
\com{From VIS'14 Paper}
The lumbar spine was detected in the image data using a hierarchical finite element method by Rak et al. [32]. This semiautomatic method requires the user to initialize the tetrahedron-based finite element models (FEM) with a click on the L3 vertebra. Two user-defined landmarks on the top and bottom of the L3 vertebra describe an initial model height estimation. The model uses a weighted sum of T1and T2-weighted MR images to detect the lumbar spine shape. Once registered, it captures information about the shape of the lumbar spine canal as well as the position of the L1-L5 vertebrae [21]. Due to incorrect initialization, strongly deformed spines, contrast differences and artifacts, the model was not able to detect lumbar spines for all subjects. We obtained and worked with 2,540 tetrahedron models of the lumbar spine. For clustering, we extracted the centerline of the lumbar spine canal, which captures information about lordosis and scoliosis (the medical terms for spine curvature) [21].
