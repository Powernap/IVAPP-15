## Compiling
Since the *SCITEPRESS* Chief Editor wanted to include EPS files instead of PDFs, you have to compile the document using `latex`, not `pdftex` and convert the resulting `draft.eps` to a PDF (my setup: Change Compiler to `latex` in `TextMate` and open the `.PS`  file in `Preview`, which automatically converts it to a PDF file.)
